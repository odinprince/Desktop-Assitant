# Voice Assistant using Gradio and SpeechRecognition

This repository contains code for a simple voice assistant named Jarvis. It uses the Gradio library for the interface, the SpeechRecognition library for speech recognition, and the pyttsx3 and pywhatkit libraries for text-to-speech and playing songs on YouTube.

## Dependencies

- gradio
- speech_recognition
- pyttsx3
- pywhatkit

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install gradio SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit
```

## How to Run

To run the voice assistant, simply run the Python script:

```bash
python DEsktop Assistant.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface in your web browser. Click the "Record" button to give a command to Jarvis. If you say "play" followed by a song name, Jarvis will play that song on YouTube.
